## Changelog
* v1.3 work-in-progress

* v1.2
  * Colour scheme changes.
    * Removed pairs of simliar colours.
    * Date is now always drawn in contrasting colour from background.

## TODOs
* Colour scheme needs to be fixed.
  * Bluetooth indicator colour of white & light gray may be too hard to differentiate.
